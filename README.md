## FAQ

### Picture-in-Picture gets under windows on Linux/Wayland

Since Wayland protocol doesn't support to set windows always on top, there're no possible way to do it without a Window-Manager trick.

* If you're using KWin Windows Manager (Default Windows Manager of KDE Desktop Environment), you can set a new window rule to keep on top.

* If you're using Ubuntu or based distro, you can look up [this extension](https://github.com/Rafostar/gnome-shell-extension-pip-on-top) to get working.

### Windows 7 Support

There're no official support for Windows 7, however it can work with some tricks.

> [!CAUTION]
> Don't forget there's no support for Windows 7. And using any trick to make the application working, the application can be crash randomly times. Also it can cause security bugs.

* You can try with [Supermium Electron](https://github.com/win32ss/supermium-electron). It's port of Electron for Windows 7.
